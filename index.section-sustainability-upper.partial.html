    <p class="main__sustainability-text">Respect for the land, for our local farmers who raise and gather in the crops, and for bakers who bake bread by hand for us to enjoy at the table every day. From land to a table, bread is a symbol of our life cycle. We are passionate about creating nutritious and healthy bread to support your healthy lifestyle.</p>
