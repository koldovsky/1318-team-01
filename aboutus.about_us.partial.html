                Our passion for baking is rooted in the belief that every loaf, and pastry tells a story — one of craftsmanship, tradition, and community. At Crumb & Co., we pride ourselves on using the finest locally-sourced ingredients and time-honored techniques to create breads and pastries that are as beautiful as they are delicious.
